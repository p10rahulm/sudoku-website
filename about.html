                        Sudoku working values are maintained as numbers from 1 to 511 representing each of the 2^11
                        options that a single cell can take.
                        <br><br>
                        Think of this as a 9 length array of the form
                        [1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1] which means that the cell can take values 9,5,3,2,and 1. This state is
                        translated in binary as 279 and this is the state of the cell. This is stored in an array. This
                        makes it easier to perform operations as we use bitwise operators to remove and add elements to
                        such arrays.
                    </div>
                    <div id="about-heap" class="inactive">
                        <div class="home-header3">Process Next Queue</div>
                        First we look at how we store items in the process next queue. We have items indices from 0-80
                        and priorities from 1 to 9 based on the number of digits that the particular cell can take.
                        Thus if the priority is 1, then the cell can hold only 1 value and priority is 9 then
                        the cell can take all 9 possible values. We get the priority by counting the number of bits
                        in the working value.
                        <br><br>
                        Now that we have the priority and the index, we could have created a node which stores the
                        sorts based on priority and holds the value. But we can do still better by coding the element
                        as a 3 digit number: the first digit being the priority and the second and third being the
                        index. Thus index 15 having priority 3 is coded 315.
                        <br><br>
                        Our Process-Next queue is a priority queue which we have implemented with the primitive
                        data structure of the heap. Since the main operations we are interested in is to get the
                        least value element, we can keep adding elements to the heap. The cheap operations in the
                        heap are delete min which takes O(log(n)) and addition to heap which also takes O(log(n)).
                        The third operation which we should do is to delete elements whose priority changes. Thus
                        if index 15 has priority 3, but due to some other element in same row, one of the possibilities
                        is eliminated, it's priority changes to 2. Then the heap should change 315 to 215. In this
                        case, we don't actually delete 315, but let it remain on the heap. The reason is that
                        copying the entire heap is inexpensive and we don't pay too much for holding an extra value.
                        Also if after processing 215, we get to 315, we don't spend any extra time processing it.

            <div class="inactive  home-textpara2" id="about-update">
                <div class="home-header2">Updates</div>
                There are two parts to the update step.
                <ul>
                    <li onclick="toggleDisplay('user-input-updates');undisplay('solution-updates');">During User Input

                        &#9660
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <div class="home-textpara3">
                    <div id="user-input-updates" class="inactive">
                        <div class="home-header3">Updates during user input</div>
                        When the user is inputting states, we allow the user to only input some elements, which means
                        we are maintaining the list of allowed elements per cell. We store the list of allowed elements
                        as a bit array which is encoded into a number.
                        <br><br>
                        For instance, if the list of allowed elements in a particular cell is 2, 3, 5 and 9, we have
                        the corresponding bit array as [1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0]. This can be encoded as the number 278
                        which is 2^8+2^4+2^2+2^1. This makes it easy for us to do binary operations.
                        <br><br>
                        When a user adds a new number, we have a fixed value in that cell now. Thus we can encode that
                        cell as 2^(number-1). Now we can also eliminate the possibility that the number exists in any
                        of it's neighboring cells in it's (1) row (2) column and (3) box. Further after multiple such
                        deletions some element may itself have only one possible number left. In such case we can add
                        it to a queue for processing. But we don't do this step until the solution has started in case
                        the user decides to delete a number.
                        <br><br>
                        When the user adds a number we bitwise-and it with it's neighbours. When a user deletes a number
                        that existed, we bitwise-or that number with it's neighbours
                        <br><br>
                        Finally we also have to account for the heap where neighbouring elements that have some of their
                        values deleted have to move further up the heap. This is a simple operation that takes O(log(n))
                        time on the heap.
                    </div>
                    <div id="solution-updates" class="inactive">
                        <div class="home-header3">Updates during solving sudoku</div>
                        All the update steps that are done when user is inputting values are also done when the
                        sudoku is getting solved.
                        <br><br>
                        In addition, at any point where we are not further able to continue processing of the sudoku
                        using simple steps, we also do combinatorial testing of cells to take on various values. The
                        major test here is to not do a naive combinatorial test and instead we use the priority heap
                        the highest priority (min-bits in allowed bit-encoding) cell is taken up and we fix a value
                        and test further as to other values in the Sudoku
                        <br><br>
                        Note that since the depth of the sudoku may be extremely large, we take up a prioritized
                        depth first search rather than a breadth first search as BFS may take up too much memory. We
                        have also chosen not to take up parallelization like dynamic programming exploring all
                        directions as we still are provided with only 1 thread on which to do the processing.

                    <div class="home-header3">Solution Technique</div>
                    The solution technique we have to solve the Sudoku is prioritized DFS with backtracking. Now
                    let us go over each of these terms
                    <br><br>
                    So first step of this solution happens as the user is inputting the numbers of the Sudoku. At this
                    stage a first level check on the elements on the same row, column and box not having the same
                    number is done. Due to this pre-check, we already have some degree of processing in our hands.
                    Though in terms of processing time this is not high, in terms of the user input incorrect numbers
                    by mistake, we already have a better interface in terms of usability.
                    <br><br>
                    Post this stage, we may have some some elements which have just 1 possiblility waiting in a
                    processed list. Apart from that all others have 2 or more "available-choices" which are stored
                    in a heap in order of priority. Therefore we pick up the top element index from this above list
                    and "add" it to the sudoku. When we add an element, we check its neighbours for the value and
                    remove them through a binary and operation. Thus to remove the possibility of 3 from a list of
                    available choices 1 through 9, we just take 511 & ~4. Note that ~4 gives us negation of 4 (switching
                    ones for zeros and vice versa) and 4 is 2^(3-1), our representation of 3.
                    <br><br>
                    After such simple updates are done, we may find that we don't have any possible values to "simple-
                    update". Then we go into the heap to look for an element which we can combinatorially evaluate.
                    We get such an index using del-min operation. Note that our encoding was 3 digit with first letter
                    for priority. Thus elem index 27 with priority 5 would be 527. We appropriately remove such an index
                    and retrieve its available choice encoding. Such a choice would be a number which has 5 ones in its
                    binary representation. We obtain the digits through binary operations. We would then, in this case
                    take 5 copies of the original Sudoku object and insert the 5 choices into the appropriate
                    index (27). Once this is done, we add these new Sudokus to a Sudoku Holder Stack.
                    <br><br>
                    The sudoku holder stack consists of all the sudoku's that we want to combinatorially look at. Since
                    we are using a stack rather than a queue, we are looking to simulate DFS rather than BFS. Further,
                    since we are choosing where to explore through a priority list, we can call this a prioritized DFS
                    <br><br>
                    While we attempt simple checks on the Sudoku according to the neighbours, since the Integer program
                    is quite complex, we will often run into contradictions during our search for the solution. Such
                    contradictions appear when we have no possible entry for a particular element. In such a case, we
                    mark the contradiction in the particular Sudoku object and <b>backtrack</b> to a previous node
                    in our graph of Sudoku solution searches. Thus our solution search method may be called as
                    backtracking prioritized DFS search.
                    <br><br>
                    The implementation of the solver at this stage was initially recursive. But the recursive program
                    was prone to stack overflows and also to excess time possibly due to function switch time. Thus
                    we have coded the DFS search as an iterative program for speed benefits
                </div>
                <div id="solution-variables" class="inactive">
                    <div class="home-header3">State variables associated with the solution</div>
                    We store a class for the iteration associated with the solution. Since this is a class, there can
                    be many instances. We use such programming methods to do averaging of multiple solutions.Note that
                    the iteration is a class instance used to store all kinds of variables associated with
                    the program. In particular, we use it to store times associated with various parts of the program.
                    <br><br>
                    Since the basic idea is to optimize the speed to the extent possible, we have optimized one of
                    the largest time taking areas of the code, viz. copying the Sudoku object. For this reason, we
                    looked at various objects getting copied and found that array copy is fastest through the
                    slice(0) method. While both arr[index] and hashmap[index] get us the required value in constant
                    time, we find that creating a cloning of an array is much faster than cloning of what in js
                    is known as an associative array.
