AI has come to play an increasingly important role in our lives, in companies and in society. As the 21st century
promises to be the century of AI, India seeks to be at the forefront of this knowledge. The all-pervasive nature
of AI algorithms is likely to increasingly affect a variety of domains and we at MTech AI at IISc want to
drive this change.
~~~
Our course seeks to build up competencies in AI research in India. The first-principles nature of the teaching here
ensures that students don't simply apply tools and algorithms, but push forward the frontiers of knowledge in
this fast-evolving field. The nature of the course gives a lot of importance to mathematical thinking and
to theory, which enables the students to not just see what is working in AI, but
also why many of the techniques work the way they do.
~~~
The AI course at IISc is jointly offered jointly by 4 different departments. Computer Science, Electrical Engineering,
Communications Engineering and Electronic Systems Engineering. This enables students to seek out interest areas in
speech, vision, robotics and even theoretical ML, which all require. IISc is of course the foremost research Institute
in India, and offers a great degree of freedom for student to take up their research interests. With the capabilities,
knowledge and skillsets gained here, we are sure the students passing out of this program will be at the
cutting edge of AI in India.
